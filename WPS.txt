There are many versions of the same story. Some say he rode a pale horse into town. Others said he was carried in, on some sort of chariot. Either way, he came into town with nothing but some leather and a road weary bible. Who knew that a drifter like him would have caused so much trouble.You see, it turned out that he was after some folks who raised hell in San Francisco. And he followed them all the way to here. He didn’t look like a law man. Nor did he seem to have blood in his eyes.
